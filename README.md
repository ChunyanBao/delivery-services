# delivery-services

Copyright (c) 2018 ChunyanBao

The purpose of this program is to create an object oriented program that will provide 
three different types of delivery service: Standard, Express, and by Drone.

Standard - For standard delivery, the driver will find the best route to take to deliver
           all of the packages, but time is not of the essence.
           
Express - Express delivery must find the fastest route to delivery the package. An express
          delivery service can have up to 3 packages being delivered at any one trip.
          
By Drone - Delivery by drone means that only one package can be delivered at a time. The 
           package must be under 10 pounds and under 1 sq ft. They do not need to find a
           route (since roads are not used).
